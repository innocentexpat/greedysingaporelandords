# Greedy Singapore Landords
All the greedy landlords will be accounted here, make sure to contribute your story, so we can avoid the greedy landlords. we are expats not slaves. stay united.

# How to register your experience and greedy behaviour of your landlords
1. Create a folder name like this (example : 540202-blk212-#04-1012) ; PINCODE -BLOCK - UNIT NUMBER
2. Create a file name like this ( example : RENTAL-SHARED-May2016-to-June2019 ); RENTAL - SHARED/WHOLE - STARTMONTHYEAR - to - ENDMONTHYEAR
3. Update your owner behaviour ( way of extorting money , disturbing behaviour  or rental abuse or mental torture ), more details about how they charge on the deposit while you are not renewing the lease/contract. Ways to avoid these kind of people , your mental disturbance, office pressure due to landlords and stress, conflict with other guests in home due to landlords. Their evas-dropping nature, cunning behviours , fake threatening. 
  
Dos and Dont's
1. Make sure avoid the names, their relative names
2. Make sure describe the person fully by nature, color, race and acclaiming behaviours ( For example, some landlords say "I know obama. I know Lee family". Some landlords are Cunning singaporean became indian landlords. Too much selfish. Act like jesure. Reacts like marlin manroe. Beautiful landlord but very threatening)
  
As per LAW, you are open to identify a person by color, ract, behviour but cannot by name.
So, we go legal and try to maintain the expat experience information shared without pointing any one specifically, to keep the landlords starve and understand what happens if they keep on greedy, extortic behaviour on the nomadic expats.
  
  
Expats, singaporeans ( who experienced their own singaporean rental landlords greedy behavior) are encoraged to share their experience.
 
Expats ( Can be German , French guy, Ang mo guy , Ang mo girl, lady , All south asians indonesian, malaysians,.... all expats who are cheated / threatened / extorted by calling police, please please share your experience ).
  
This will help other expats to avoid those landlords.
  
  
Thanks you.
